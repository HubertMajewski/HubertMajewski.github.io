					<p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: center;">I am  19 
						years old and I study Computer Science. I graduated high school from Michael J. Petrides and now go to Queens College. With honesty, 
						I am not sure what I want to do as my career. I am always fond of programming and learning how computers tick. I feel like I have improved 
						a great deal by spending time here in Queens. I have been challenged with rigorous writing assignments and test questions that made me think 
						in a whole new perspective. Queens College has taught me to think differently than I normally would have. They are changing me in how I would 
						view a certain problem, and while maintaining this perspective is hard for me, it is nice to know that I don't have to solve a problem knowing 
						one single series of steps. When I write, for example, I focus on such small details that my paper eventually runs out of ideas and the flow becomes 
						very rocky. By thinking more "inside the box," my Queens college professors have taught me that I do not have to be so detail-oriented and that 
						I should not only focus on details of details, but also generalize and take a step back. I plan to continue exploring new challenges and methods 
						to solving any challenges no matter the complexity of any disciplinary field, may it be cultural studies, database organization, artificial intelligence, 
						cryptography, etc.</p>
